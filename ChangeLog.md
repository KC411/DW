# 1.6.2 - 2022-06-26
- The text-mode client should now support Unicode input when in UTF-8
  locales, e.g. allowing player names containing accented characters
  to be input (#60).
- Add support for networking on the Haiku operating system (thanks
  to Begasus) (#61).

# 1.6.1 - 2020-12-11
- Improved display in non-English text-mode clients; previously
  columns were not aligned properly in some cases and occasionally
  not all available drugs at a location were shown on screen (#54).
- Minimal British English translation added (#57). Configuration file
  entries can now use either British English or American English spelling
  (i.e. Armor/Armour).
- On Windows the "browse" button in the graphical client options dialog
  now opens at the folder containing the selected sound file (#55).

# 1.6.0 - 2020-12-06
- Fixes to build with OpenWRT (thanks to Theodor-Iulian Ciobanu).
- Write server pidfile after fork (thanks to Theodor-Iulian Ciobanu).
- Updated German and French Canadian translations from Benjamin Karaca
  and Francois Marier.
- Support for old GTK1 and GLIB1 libraries removed - we now need version 2
  of these libraries to build dopewars. GTK+3 is also supported.
- Update metaserver to work with new SourceForge; older versions can no
  longer successfully register with the metaserver.
- Switch to using libcurl to talk to the metaserver (this supports https,
  unlike the old internal code). The metaserver configuration has changed
  accordingly; `MetaServer.Name`, `MetaServer.Port` and `MetaServer.Path` are
  replaced with `MetaServer.URL`, while `MetaServer.Auth`, `MetaServer.Proxy*`,
  and `MetaServer.UseSocks` are removed (set the `https_proxy` environment
  variable instead, as per
  https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-tutorial.html#Environment)
- The default web browser on Linux has changed from 'mozilla' to
  'firefox'; on Mac the system-configured default browser is used.
- On Windows the high score file, log file, and config file are now
  stored in the user application data directory (e.g.
  `C:\Users\foo\AppData\Local\dopewars`) rather than the same directory as
  the dopewars binary.
- Add sound support with SDL2, and on Mac.
- Add 64-bit Windows binaries.
- Fix for a DOS against the server using the REQUESTJET message type
  (thanks to Doug Prostko for reporting the problem).

# 1.5.12 - 2005-12-30

  an NT service (user data was being used as a format string in some cases).

# 1.5.11 - 2005-12-30
- Add example configuration file to the documentation.
- Fixed various typos in the German translation (thanks to Jens Seidel
  and Francois Marier).
- Fix a remote exploit against the Win32 server (thanks to KF).

  directory if available, to work more efficiently on multi-user systems.

# 1.5.10 - 2004-10-24
- High score file is now installed in `${localstatedir}` rather than
  `${datadir}`, to allow proper Filesystem Hierarchy Standard compliance

  by the cops
- Some problems with the curses client missing screen resize events fixed
- Logging to a file should now work properly again
- Minimum and maximum limits on all relevant integer configuration
  file variables are now imposed for sanity
- Quique's Spanish translation is now available both in standard Spanish
  (`es.po`) and `es_ES.po`, which uses drugs slang from Spain

- Windows installer no longer hardcodes `C:\Program Files` so should
  work with non-English versions of Windows

# 1.5.9 - 2003-06-07

  + and - keys
- The curses client now makes better use of space with screen sizes
  larger than 80x24
- Fix for a crash encountered if you drop drugs and then encounter the cops
- Addition of -P, --player command line option to set the player name
  to use (thanks to Michael Mitton)

# 1.5.8 - 2002-10-21
- Options dialog now allows sounds for all supported game events to be set
- BindAddress config variable added, to allow the server to be bound to
  a non-default IP address
- BankInterest and DebtInterest variables added, to allow the
  configuration of interest rates (with thanks to Matt)
- New "UTF8" ability added; if client and server share this ability, then
  all network messages will be sent in UTF-8 (Unicode) encoding (without
  the ability, all messages are assumed to be in your locale's default
  codeset, which may cause problems on non-US ASCII systems)
- Names.Month and Names.Year have been replaced with StartDate.Day,
  StartDate.Month, StartDate.Year and Names.Date; these can be used to
  handle the date display properly after the turn number exceeds 31
- encoding and include config directives added, to allow the config file's
  encoding (usually taken from the locale) to be overridden, and to allow
  the inclusion of other config files
- Spanish translation added by Quique
- The Windows build of dopewars should now use Unicode throughout, on
  platforms with Unicode support (i.e. NT/2000/XP)
- Under Windows XP, the "pretty" new common controls are now used
- Sounds provided by Robin Kohli of www.19.5degs.com

- Sound support; Windows multimedia, ESD and SDL outputs are supported;
  the individual modules can be statically linked in, or built as true
  "plugins"
- Version mismatches between client and server are now treated more
  sensibly (it's all done server-side, and spurious warnings are now
  removed - only an old client connecting to a new server will
  trigger them)
- Bug fix: when the buttons in the Fight dialog are not visible to a
  mouse user, previously you were able to access them via the keyboard
  shortcuts; now fixed.
- configure should now work properly if GLib 2.0 is installed but
  GTK2.0 is not
- Norwegian Nynorsk translation added by Åsmund
- If dopewars is run setuid/setgid, it will now only use this privilege
  to open the default (hard-coded) high score file; it will not open
  a user-specified high score file with privilege
- It is no longer necessary to run "dopewars -C" on a zero-byte high
  score file; it will be converted automatically
- A new server command "save" can be used to save the current configuration
  to a named config file

# 1.5.6 - 2002-04-29
- Bug fix: the server will only let you pay back loans or deal with the
  bank when you are at the correct location, and you can no longer
  "pay back" negative amounts of cash to the loan shark
- Minor improvements to fighting code
- The GTK+2 client should now run properly in non-UTF8 locales, and
  handle configuration files in both UTF8 and non-UTF8 locales

  "windows pop up faster than you can close them" syndrome)
- Support for HTTP proxies and authentication
- SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 (user/password) support
- French translation added by leonard
- Boolean configuration variables (TRUE/FALSE) now supported
- Many code cleanups
- High score files now have a "proper" header, so that file(1) can
  identify them, and so the -f option cannot be used to force setgid-games
  dopewars to overwrite random files writeable by group "games" - use
  the -C option to convert old high score files to the new format
- GNU long command line options now accepted on platforms with `getopt_long`
- Simple installer now in place for Win32 systems

- Completely rewritten fighting code
- Internationalization (i18n) support
- Tense and case-sensitive translated strings handled via `dpg_` analogues
  to glib's `g_` string handling functions `%P` = price,
  `%Txx` or `%txx` = tense-sensitive string, `%/.../` = comment (ignored)
- Networking revamped - now uses nonblocking sockets to improve server
  responsiveness and to remove deadlocks (previously, any client could
  halt server by sending an unterminated message); "abilities" added to
  allow backwards-compatible protocol extensions; player IDs used rather
  than player names to save bandwidth, with newer client+server
- Drug values now stored by server (e.g. "you have 5 Weed @ $600); sent
  only if DrugValue config. variable is set, and only to new clients
  (based on a patch by Pierre F)
- Spying fixed (cannot now spy on a player until they accept your bitch)
- Longer `T>alk` and `P>age` messages allowed in curses client
- Minor bug fixes to configure options
- configure script tweaked to fix networking under Solaris (and friends)
  (with thanks to Caolan McNamara)
- Client-side code moved out of `clientside.c` and `dopewars.c`;
  client-specific code now placed in `<xxx>_client.c`, while generic code is
  in `message.c`

  (of the format { "string1", "string2", "string3" } ) are now supported
  for configuration of subway sayings, "stopped to" and overheard songs
- Timeouts bug fixed
- MaxClients bug fixed

# 1.4.8 - 2000-07-09
- Several fixes to Win32 networking code
- IdleTimeout and ConnectTimeout variables added, to allow the server to
  break connections that have been idle for too long, or take too long
  to (dis)connect, respectively
- Servers now use UDP packets to communicate with metaserver, for 
  a faster response to changing game conditions; the client, and older
  versions of the server, still use the "old" CGI script interface;
  MetaServer.Port variable split into .HttpPort and .UdpPort
- MetaServer.Password can now be used with a blank MetaServer.LocalName
  (with the new metaserver interface only) in order to identify servers
  whose IPs are dynamic (but are otherwise the "same" server); this password
  must, again, be acquired from the metaserver maintainer
- Metaserver now records current & maximum numbers of players, high
  scores, and last update time and uptime, for each server
- Servers now re-register with metaserver when players join or leave,
  on receipt of a SIGUSR1 signal, and periodically

  now takes them back to the fighting screen

# 1.4.7 - 2000-01-14

- dopewars now uses autoconf to (hopefully) build properly on odd sytems
  such as HP-UX, and also to build "out of the box" under Cygwin (win32)
- long long datatype used for all prices on platforms that support it
- fixes to strtoprice and pricetostr code; replacement of code which
  uses printf("%ld") for prices with pricetostr calls (with thanks to
  Coolio)
- "Leave" option added to Bank
- Messages window is now only displayed for network games
- Binary can be compiled without TCP/IP networking support (e.g. for use
  on standalone systems) by configuring with --disable-networking
- Minor modification to config. file handling to allow variables to be set
  to null strings (use "Variable=")
- Option to allow the "local" server name to be specified when registering
  with the metaserver - MetaServer.LocalName variable. Useful when the
  metaserver refuses to resolve your IP address to your "preferred" domain
  name or when connecting via an enforced web proxy. Email the metaserver
  maintainer, for an authentication password (MetaServer.Password) linked to
  your chosen domain name, to use this option successfully.

# 1.4.6 - 1999-11-12

  to a resize during the program run doesn't work properly yet...
- Minor improvements to AI players
- Corrected website address displayed by client on connecting to a
  server of a different version
- If player opts to play again, defaults to the name they used last time
- Server now disconnects clients when their game ends (rather than
  waiting for them to politely disconnect) - this gets around the problem
  of particularly unresponsive clients getting killed and then sitting
  around in an "undead" state, able to be repeatedly killed by other
  players
- Armed players cannot now "stand and take it" (why would you want to
  anyway?) in multiplayer fights
- Client now offers to obtain the list of available servers from the
  metaserver, to select one to connect to
- "Special" values (MetaServer), (Prompt) and (Single) (including the
  brackets) now accepted for the "Server" variable, which instruct the
  client to list the servers, prompt the user for a server, or play
  in single-player mode, rather than connecting immediately to a server
- "MetaServer.Port" variable added to facilitate connection to the
  metaserver via a proxy server (with thanks to Tony Brown)
- Signal handling cleaned up
- Buffer overflow problem with ExtractWord() fixed (hopefully) (with thanks
  to Lamagra)
- Command line option -S for running a "private" server (do not contact
  the metaserver)
- Prices for spies and tipoffs can be customised; this information is not
  communicated properly between 1.4.5 and earlier versions, of course.
  In such a case, the game will still work properly, although the client
  may report erroneous spy and tipoff prices
- Fixed dodgy "pricetostr" function
- Bug fix for "Drop" command in single-player mode
- Command line option -g for specifying a supplementary configuration file
- FightTimeout variable fixed - it now actually does something...
- GunShop, LoanShark, RoughPub and Bank variables corrected so that they
  take actual location numbers now - not (location-1). WARNING: this
  breaks old configuration files!

- Prices of bitches for hire can now be configured - Bitch.MinPrice and
  Bitch.MaxPrice

  number of drugs and guns) (with thanks to Matt Higgins)
- "ConfigVerbose" option added to display extra feedback during config
  file processing (with thanks to Matt Higgins)

# 1.4.4 - 1999-09-16
- Full compatibility with 1.4.3 servers and clients maintained
  (although a warning is displayed to upgrade as soon as possible)
- dopewars client now properly redraws the screen when Ctrl-L is pressed
- Server output is now line-buffered by default for more sensible output
  of log files
- `L>ist` bug in single player mode fixed
- Number of game turns can now be configured with the "NumTurns"
  variable, or the game can be left to go on forever if it's set to zero
- The shortcuts "k" and "m" are now supported in any input of numbers
  (e.g. money to put in the bank). So, for instance, typing 1.5m would
  be short for typing 1500000  (m=million, k=thousand)
- Server now automatically contacts the dopewars metaserver (actually
  a CGI script), at bellatrix.pcl.ox.ac.uk, whenever it is brought up or
  down, to keep the list of servers on the dopewars webpage up to date.
  Aspects of the server's communication with the metaserver can be
  configured with the MetaServer.xxx variables
- Names of the two police officers which chase you (originally
  Hardass and Bob) can now be configured with the variables
  "Names.Officer" and "Names.ReserveOfficer" respectively
  (provided by: Mike Meyer)
- Several uses of the  string constant "bitches" rather than
  the variable "Names.Bitches" have been spotted, and corrected
  (provided by: Mike Meyer)
- "Sanitized" variable - if nonzero, removes drug references
  (random events, the cops, etc.) - obviously drug names need to also
  be changed in the config. file to complement this. Turns dopewars into
  a simple trading game (provided by: Mike Meyer)
- Minor formatting cleanups to accommodate longer drug names on the
  screen neatly (provided by: Mike Meyer)

# 1.4.3 - 1999-06-23
- Bug with random offer of weed/paraquat fixed
- `L>ist` command now offers list of logged-on players or high scores
- "Out of time" message to explain why the game stops suddenly after 31 days
- Bank is now a little more user-friendly
- Messages announcing players leaving or joining the game now appear in
  the central "messages" window, rather than the main, bottom window
- Clients should now behave properly after the server crashes (or they
  are pushed off the server) - i.e. they should revert to a single-player
  mode game
- `price_t` type used for all prices
- Server interactive interface is now greatly improved, complete with
  help screen
- `SO_REUSEADDR` set so that server can be restarted immediately if it crashes
- Facility to drop unwanted drugs, with the accompanying chance that you
  are caught by Officer Hardass and shot at
- Fighting interface greatly improved:-
  - All player-player fighting now occurs in a specialised window. Players
    can switch between the standard "deal drugs" window and the fighting
    window with the D and F keys
  - Number of keystrokes required to shoot and acknowledge all the
    relevant messages now greatly reduced
  - Some indication is now given of the other player's status (number of
    bitches and guns)
  - Server now imposes timeouts on fights, so if an opponent does not
    return fire within a set time, a repeat attack is allowed
  - A bounty is paid out for killing an enemy bitch, and any guns/drugs
    they're carrying are passed on to the victor (if he/she is able to
    carry them)
  - A dead player's cash is appropriated by the victor of a fight
- Handling of configuration files now greatly improved; the same options
  that are set here can also be set within the server as long as no
  players are connected. A large number of dopewars settings can be
  changed and customised from here. Customised settings will be used
  in single-player mode, and if dopewars is used as a server the settings
  will be propagated to any clients (of version 1.4.3 or higher) that
  connect. Not everything can be customised, but any remaining changes
  should be server-side only (and thus require no alteration to the 
  clients). Options include:-
  - MaxClients option to limit the maximum number of players connected
    to the server
  - FightTimeout option to alter the length of the fight timeout
  - StartCash and StartDebt to change the default starting cash and debt
    of every player
  - Probabilities and toughness of Officer Hardass and his deputies can
    be "tweaked"
  - Numbers and names of locations, drugs and guns can be altered
  - The words used to denote "bitches", "guns" and "drugs" can be 
    customised
  - Drugs can now be sorted by name or by price, in forwards or reverse
    order, with the DrugSortMethod option (can take values 1-4)

# 1.4.2 - 1999-05-16
- AI player improvements
- Message structure changed to use less bandwidth and neater code
- Now easier to break out of buy/sell drug prompts etc. (by pressing an 
  'invalid' key or ENTER)

  their spies or tipoffs with other players
- Added highlight of most recent score (for systems without working 
  `A_STANDOUT` attribute)

  guns to be Saturday Night Specials
- Prevented badly-behaved clients from continuing to jet to new locations
  after their death 
- Added code to remove whitespace from name=value data read from 
  configuration file, and defaulted from $HOME/.dopewars to /etc/dopewars

  work properly
- GunShop / LoanShark / Bank / Pub all handled by the server now
- Some networking bugfixes 

# 1.3.0 - 1999-02-20
- Development series (moving decision-making from client to server to
  improve multi-player games and cut down on cheating, in preparation
  for an OpenSource release)
- Simple implementation of a "virtual server" to handle the server-side
  stuff within a single-player game

# 1.1.22 - 1999-01-30
- Implemented very simple "shoot at another dealers" code; players, on
  arriving at a location where another dealer already is, can choose
  to attack (if they have any guns). The attacked player can then
  choose to return fire or run for it...

# 1.1.21 - 1999-01-29
- Added support for the "spy on another dealer" bitch errand

# 1.1.20 - 1999-01-29
- Added support for the "tip off another dealer to the cops" bitch errand
